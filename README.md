# A/B Testing at WQU
In this project, I did an A/B testing at WorldQuant University. 
I Built a choropleth map showcasing the global distribution of ADSL students, implemented ETL processes with a custom Python class, designed experiments, and analyzed results using chi-square tests. Also, crafted an interactive web application following a three-tiered design pattern.

## Final Result
